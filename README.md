# Open in Colab Chrome Extension

This is a simple Chrome extension that, when clicked when viewing a Jupyter
notebook on GitHub, will open that notebook in
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

The extension simply provides a URL redirect: it reads the current URL and opens
a new tab at https://colab.research.google.com/github/ (or /gist/) with the
user, repository, and notebook path.

## Installing the Extension

The latest release of the extension can be installed from the
[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-colab/iogfkhleblhcpcekbiedikdehleodpjo).

## Support
