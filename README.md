# Open In Colab Chrome Extension

This is a simple chrome extension that, when clicked when viewing a Jupyter
notebook on github, will open that notebook in
[Google Colab](http://colab.research.google.com/).

The extension simply provides a URL redirect: it reads the current URL and opens
a new tab at http://colab.research.google.com/github/ with the user, repository,
and notebook path.

## Installing the Extension

The latest release of the extension can be installed from the
[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/open-in-colab/iogfkhleblhcpcekbiedikdehleodpjo).

## Development Install

To install the extension directly from source:

1.  Clone this repository to your local disk.
2.  Open the Chrome browser, and navigate to chrome://extensions.
3.  Ensure that developer mode is enabled (see the switch in the upper-right).
4.  Click "Load Unpacked" and choose the location of the `open_in_colab`
    repository. You should see a little colab icon appear in your Chrome
    extensions icons in your browser bar.
5.  Navigate to a notebook on github (e.g.
    https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/main/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb),
    and click the extension icon to open the notebook in Colab.
