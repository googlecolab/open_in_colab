This is a chrome extension that allows notebooks on github to be opened in

## Contributing

If you have a problem, or see something that could be improved, please file an
issue. However, we don't have the bandwidth to support review of external
contributions, and we don't want user PRs to languish, so we aren't accepting
any external contributions right now.
